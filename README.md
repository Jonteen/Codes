# File Sorting Script

This Python script is designed to help you sort files in the current directory based on their file extensions.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Place the `Sortera.py` script in the directory containing the files you want to sort.

3. navigate to the directory containing the script.

4. Run the script by double clicking on the file:

5. The script will create a folder named 'Sorterat'(Changeable) in the current directory if it doesn't already exist.

6. It will then move files into subfolders within 'Sorted' based on their file extensions. For example, all `.txt` files will be moved to a 'txt' folder, `.jpg` files to a 'jpg' folder, and so on.

7. After running the script, your files will be organized in the 'Sorted' directory.
